This project gives you the building blocks for making a Flappy Bird clone
in JavaScript. It will even work on your smart phone!

Play flappy bird on the web: http://flappybird.io/ 

Project setup
-------------

There are X screencasts with an exercise to complete for each. Each exercise
gets its own directory, an `index.html` file, and a JavaScript file named
something like `ex1.js`. After completing each exercise, you'll have all the
parts to build a fully-functioning version of the game, which you'll do in
the root `index.html` file and `js/flappy.js`.

You'll be using p5.js to draw the game elements, animate them, and respond to
user input. This is the same library Khan Academy uses, with some slight
differences, which you'll learn about in the first exercise.

The [p5.js online documentation](http://p5js.org/reference/) is your best
friend. You can remind yourself how to draw different shapes and colors there,
or even go back to Khan Academy lessons.

Exercise One: Setup
-------------------

* Flappy Bird breakdown
* Explain all the files
* How to view your code in a browser
* Drawing simple shapes
* The draw() function

Exercise Two: The Game Loop
---------------------------

* What is a game loop?
* Steps in the loop: 
    * Update
    * React
    * Draw
* Making a really dumb game

Exercise Three: The Bird
------------------------

* Breaking down the bird
* The bird object
* Acceleration
* Gravity
* Jumping
* The bounding box

Exercise Four: The Obstacle
---------------------------

* Drawing two boxes
* Randomizing the obstacle
* Looping the obstacle
* The bounding box

Exercise Five: Hit Testing
--------------------------

* Bounding boxes
* Do two boxes overlap?
* Special boxes
